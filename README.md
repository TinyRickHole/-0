Beginer Stuff:
For various diffrent OSes and languages.

Mostly basic easy to read code and config files for learnig new skillsets in programing, system setup, maintinence / repair.

This is an attempt at self teaching for my own pursuit of skillset expansion for career and personal development. 
"From nothing to something."

For using/learning git, and programing concepts and procedures, to gain personal and professional expirience and skillset tracking.

All input is welcome and incurraged.
